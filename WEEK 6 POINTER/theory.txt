int* ptr: ptr is a pointer to interger data.
*ptr - value stored at location in ptr
&ptr - address of ptr
&a - address of a
a - value of a 
ptr - value of ptr



***pointer stores the address therefore the size of pointer is 8 or system architecture.

Segmentation fault- Access some other memory.

In case of arrays:

arr
&arr
&arr[0]
These all have same base address 

*(i + arr) or arr[i] or i[arr] both give same result

using pointer we can access a sub-part.
