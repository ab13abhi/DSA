BINARY SEARCH:

->On 1000 elements there are 10 comparisons
->order must be monotonic
->find start
->find end
->find middle = start + (end - start)/2

->Time Complexity is going n/2-->n/4-->n/8
.... so on.

->Using pre-defined STL template
if(binary_search(v.begin(), v.end(), 30)){
    cout << "Found" << endl;
}

->IMPORTANT POINT 
if doing (s = mid + 1) or (e = mid - 1)
you can do (s <= e).
But if doing (s = mid) or (e = mid)
you can use only (s < e), else stuck in infinite loop.
